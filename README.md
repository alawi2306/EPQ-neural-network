# EPQ-neural-network

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for my Extended Project Qualification neural network project. This project publicly publishes the code available to everyone, and the code can be found in the file named `epq2.py`.

## Overview

The neural network is designed to  to create an artificial neural network to assess the likelihood of coronary heart disease (CAD) developing based on the level of cholesterol in the body.

## Files

- `epq2.py`: The main Python script containing the neural network implementation and training process.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

- Python [version]
- NumPy [version]
- Pandas [version]
- Matplotlib [version]
- scikit-learn [version]
- TensorFlow [version]

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
